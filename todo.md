* minmax fails when precision too high (for example 1)
* minmax fails with data: cos(x)|deg 2|start -2|end 2|precision 0.01 (symmetrical interval)
* minmax fails with data: x^2|deg 1|start 1|end 3|precision 0.01


* add validation for input fields (degree cannot be fractional)
* resize graph on window resize
* add login/logout (for what => for personalized history)

* plot error plot for lssq (it should be interesting)

#Done
* form should perist its values between view transitions
* minimize client.min.js (now it weights 5.8 Mb)
